#Snooze

>This library is latest revision based on my earlier work on the LowPowwer_Teensy3. I changed the name to not confict with the Arduino LowPower library plus I think it sounds cooler.

<h4>Compatiable with Teensyduino 1.20</h4> 

<h3>Intial Release:</h3>
1.  Trimmed down and simplfied, try to mimic standard Arduino conventions for setting pins, etc..<br>
2.  Since Teensyduino now can be programed at many different CPU speeds, dynamically changing cpu speeds is no longer supported, maybe in future I can bring it back if wanted.<br>
3.  Now teensy can sleep at ~10uA with hibernate function. Special care is need when using this function.
